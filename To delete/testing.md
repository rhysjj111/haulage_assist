## Form validation

#### Edit entries
Each of the above parameters were tested when editing an entry. A key difference is the user edits an entry in a modal and this must be re-opened with the pre-populated form, and warning message. If no validation is required, the main driver entry page is loaded with the success message. Another difference comes because, if the user does not change the name, the validation checks the database and finds the same name and throws an error. A check at the edit route skips this validation if the name is the same as it was before the user submits the edit form.

#### Delete entries
A warning modal pops up prompting the user to confirm deleting an entry. On confirmation, the selected driver gets deleted each time.
